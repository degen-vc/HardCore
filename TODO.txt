testing:
1. create mock Uniswap LP and mock Uniswap router --DONE
2. transfer on paused fails -- DONE
3. transfers increase fees for distributor --DONE
4. Transfers on whitelists and blacklists --DONE
5. purchase LP with zero eth fails
6. LP created is locked for x days
7. In the absence of activity, LP claimed contains the original tokens.
8. Claiming before duration up fails
9. transferGrab
10. Donations on claim

Exit fee

Thoughts: allow infinit eth to be forwarded wich is just truncated.
