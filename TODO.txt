testing:
1. create mock Uniswap LP and mock Uniswap router
2. transfer on paused fails
3. transfers increase fees for distributor
4. Transfers on whitelists and blacklists
5. purchase LP with zero eth fails
6. LP created is locked for x days
7. In the absence of activity, LP claimed contains the original tokens.
8. Claiming before duration up fails
9. transferGrab

Thoughts: allow infinit eth to be forwarded wich is just curtailed.
